Today, I suddenly discovered that my Reddit account had been banned. The reason was that I ignored an email asking me to reset my password. After resetting the password and trying to log in again, I found that my account was behaving abnormally—my avatar and other information were missing, and I couldn’t access my profile. It kept showing “We had a server error...”.

Additionally, I lost some articles, which left me feeling very frustrated. Reddit is a great platform, but there are some aspects I really dislike—for example, the formatting system and the seemingly random removal of posts, including a help post I made in r/help.

I've long been searching for a blogging platform that could serve as an alternative to GitHub Docs. While Reddit allows you to publish articles, they often get removed for unclear reasons, and the Markdown editor is extremely difficult to use. I finally decided to look for a better platform. I’ve used [dev.to](http://dev.to) and several other tech blogging platforms before, but I had never heard of Hashnode before—which is such a shame.

After trying to republish a few removed Reddit posts on Hashnode, I immediately fell in love with the code editor. It's beautifully designed and incredibly easy to use. The UI feels extremely modern (some Reddit pages honestly look like they’re from the 90s—I even suspected I had clicked a phishing link). This is the only editor I’ve seen that offers a writing experience better than Feishu Docs. Plus, it supports one-click export and backup, which makes future platform migration very convenient.

Reddit’s community is incredibly active. Every time I post an interesting article there, I receive a lot of valuable feedback. But the terrible writing experience is a huge letdown. It looks like from now on, I’ll be learning on Reddit but writing on Hashnode.
